# CemetryOrganizationInAnts
The idea of this Project was to come up with a model of ant behavior wherein the colony of ants is able to efficiently cluster/sort the randomly distributed set of objects, without any global co-ordination scheme. In my study of models, I used Spatial entropy and plot it's behavior as the experiment runs in order to quantify the performance of the model.

The website showing the results is given below:
